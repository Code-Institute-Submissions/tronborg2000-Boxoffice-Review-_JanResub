## Introduction

- The hover effects on the social media icons and nav menus in this project were implemented to provide a more interactive and engaging experience for the user.

## Social Media Icons
The social media icons are located in the header of the page. When the user hovers their mouse over the icons, the color of the icon changes to indicate that they are clickable. This helps the user understand that they can interact with the icons and be directed to the corresponding social media page.

## Nav Menus
- The nav menus in this project are located in the header of the page. When the user hovers their mouse over the menu items, the background color changes to indicate that they are clickable. This helps the user understand that they can interact with the menu items and be directed to the corresponding page.

## Social Media Icons

-The social media icons function as links to the corresponding social media pages. When clicked, the icons open the linked pages in a new tab. The "a" elements that contain the icons have the attribute "target='_blank'" which allows them to open in a new tab. The "rel='noopener'" attribute ensures that the new page does not have control over the parent page. The "aria-label" attribute provides a description of the icon for users of assistive technologies. 

- When hovered over the social media ocions change to gold to highlight the choice made. 

## Conclusion
- The hover effects on the social media icons and nav menus in this project enhance the user experience by providing a more interactive and engaging interface.

## Review Page
