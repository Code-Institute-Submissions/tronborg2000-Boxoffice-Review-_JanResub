            <h2>Black Panther: <br> 
                Wakanda Forever</h2>
            <p>Shaped around the loss of its original hero Chadwick Boseman, this take pays tribute to the late actor with fiery performances and great spectacle.
                he fictional African state of Wakanda becomes a matriarchy in a fervent, yet understandably subdued new Black Panther movie whose exuberant and mournful impulses are at odds with each other. We can also see, almost in real time, a franchise coming to terms with loss at the same as its fictional characters. Chadwick Boseman, who in the previous adventure had played T’Challa, king of Wakanda, died of cancer two years ago at just 43 years old. Now this new film pays a heartfelt and decent tribute to his memory in a drama shaped around this sudden blow, making an honest attempt to shape a superhero film around the subject of grief.

T’Challa’s sister Shuri now has to step up to a quasi-regency role alongside her grief-stricken mother Ramonda, who now becomes queen because T’Challa has suddenly died; here are two typically elegant and charismatic performances from Letitia Wright and Angela Bassett, with Wright’s Shuri now stricken not just with sadness but a new kind of bleak self-knowledge. Despite her renown as a scientist, she could do nothing to prevent or even understand T’Challa’s fatal illness.

            <h2>Retrograde</h2>
            <p>Documentary maker Matthew Heineman watches a tragedy unfold as he follows the Green Berets supporting the Afghan army in the last months of the war against the Taliban. Acclaimed documentary maker Matthew Heineman is known for his remarkable ability to stay close to subjects caught up in dangerous situations – be those fighting the drug trade in Latin America (Cartel Land), defying Isis occupation (City of Ghosts), or struggling to care for the sick during the Covid pandemic (The First Wave). This latest feature-length chronicle lays out an extraordinary insider’s view of the last months of the United States’ war against the Taliban in Afghanistan, as seen from the point of view of the last Green Berets supporting the Afghan army led by Gen Sami Sadat. While those filmed, especially the local soldiers, clearly disagree with America’s withdrawal from the region, the film itself tries to maintain a posture of journalistic neutrality. Still, just like the American soldiers who must keep repeating that it’s not up to them, you can sense that Heineman and his crew recognise they’re watching a tragedy unfold.</p>

            <h2>Dear Elizabeth</h2>
            <p>Hapless Sid tries inviting famous one-time pal Elizabeth Banks to his college reunion. Nothing goes to plan – but the film retains real warmth. he Hunger Games’ Elizabeth Banks is an unexpected choice as the muse of this Canadian comedy-drama, adapted from Michael Kun’s pre-social media-era novel about a sadsack software worker’s obsession with Heather Locklear – who, to be honest, was more front-and-centre than Banks in the zeitgeist of her day. Debut director Scott Abramovitch’s gentle film is less a look at digital-age fandom than an affable primer on accepting your own unremarkableness.

                Sid Straw (Tony Hale) is pootling along in his job as VP of marketing at a generic firm, waving/drowning on the midlife dating scene, and irritating his sister-in-law Janet (24’s Elisha Cuthbert) with his try-hard perkiness. So when he is called to organise a college reunion, he spies a golden opportunity to bolster his standing: by persuading his famous one-time pal Elizabeth Banks to attend. He begins leaving messages on her Facebook page, oversharing about his personal life and invariably signing off with “Eat wheaties!”; the special farewell the future Hollywood star would shout out to the volleyball team.</p>
